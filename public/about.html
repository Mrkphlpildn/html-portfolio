  My name is MP, residing in the Ph, and I'm a passionate individual on a quest for knowledge and growth. Having graduated in Information Technology, 
  I've embarked on a journey to carve out a promising career path, starting from the grassroots level to fortify my expertise with each stride forward. My motivation is deeply 
  rooted in my family's welfare, as I strive to augment our income streams through continuous learning and skill acquisition. With a fervent aspiration to excel as a web developer,
  I'm immersing myself in the boundless realm of programming. Currently, I'm diligently honing my skills through courses on UDEMY, particularly under the tutelage of Dr. Angela Yu, 
  embracing every opportunity to expand my horizons and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving digital landscape.
